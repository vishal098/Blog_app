# Blog_app

I have created a blog app in which the user can register and login and after that, he can post and view the blogs. 
For this app, I used Express, Mysql, Knex, and JWT for authentication:

  -Register using email & password ( use JWT for authentication )
  -Login
  -Create a post
  -See all posts from other users on home page
  -The admin can change or delete or view the blogs and the admin can delete users account.
